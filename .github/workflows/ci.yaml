# This workflow runs CI checks on an Apache Airflow DAG project.
# It includes standard Python/Airflow tests and intentionally insecure

# --- INTENTIONALLY INSECURE CONFIGURATION 1 ---
# This top-level permissions block grants write-all access to the GITHUB_TOKEN.
# This is overly permissive and should be detected by a security scanner.
# A better practice is to define minimal permissions, e.g., `permissions: contents: read`
